Optionally include links to professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub - if applicable and desired).3.2. Navigation & InteractionSmooth Scrolling: When clicking navigation links, the page should smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.CV Download Button: A button positioned in the top-right corner of the header/navigation bar. Clicking this button should trigger the download of the PDF CV file. The CV file (CV_Ansto_Chibamu.pdf) will need to be hosted or included in the project files.3.3. User Interface & ExperienceResponsive Design: The layout must be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and orientations.Clean, Minimal Aesthetic: The design should be uncluttered, professional, and easy to navigate.Modern Components: Utilize modern UI elements (cards for experience entries, styled buttons, clear section layouts).Subtle Animations: Incorporate subtle, non-intrusive animations (e.g., fade-in on scroll, hover effects) to enhance visual appeal without being distracting.Dark Mode (Preferred) / Light Mode (Optional): The primary theme should be a dark mode using slate/gray tones. An optional toggle should be available for users to switch to a light mode theme.4. Design and Technical Specifications4.1. Technology StackFrontend Framework: ReactStyling: Tailwind CSS4.2. Visual DesignColor Palette: Primarily slate/gray tones for the dark mode. A complementary palette for the optional light mode.Typography: Choose professional and readable fonts.Spacing: Consistent padding and margins to ensure a clean look.Icons: Use appropriate icons where necessary (e.g., for contact methods, skills, GitHub, education).4.3. Technical ImplementationComponent-Based Architecture: Structure the React application into reusable components (e.g., Header, Hero, About, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Contact, Card, Footer, ThemeToggle).GitHub API Integration: Implement logic to fetch public repository data from the GitHub API. Consider handling API rate limits.State Management: Use React's built-in state management or context API for simple state like the theme toggle and potentially for storing fetched project data.Routing: As it's a single-page application with smooth scrolling, explicit routing libraries might not be strictly necessary unless future expansion requires distinct pages.CV Download: Implement the download functionality. This could involve placing the PDF in the public folder and linking to it, or using a library if dynamic generation or more complex handling is needed (though for a static site, a direct link is simplest).Animations: Implement subtle animations using CSS transitions/animations or libraries like Framer Motion if more complex effects are desired (keep it subtle as per requirements).Theme Toggle: Implement logic to switch between dark and light mode by changing CSS classes or variables, likely using React state and context.5. DeploymentPlatform: GitHub Pages.Configuration: Configure the project for deployment to GitHub Pages.Deployment Scripts: Include necessary scripts in package.json (e.g., using the gh-pages package) to simplify the deployment process via the command line.6.

This structure promotes modularity and makes it easy to locate and modify specific parts of the application.7. Future Considerations (Optional)Blog Integration: Potentially integrate a simple blog to share articles or insights.Analytics: Add basic website analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to track visitor data.Accessibility: Enhance accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).Testing: Implement unit and integration tests for components.Manual Project Entries: Option to add manually curated project entries in addition to or instead of fetching all public repos.
